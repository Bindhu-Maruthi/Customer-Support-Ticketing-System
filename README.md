# Customer-Support-Ticketing-System
# Problem Statement:
In todayâ€™s business environment, providing timely and efficient customer support is critical for maintaining customer satisfaction. Many companies struggle with handling customer issues due to lack of automation, poor tracking, and limited visibility into service performance. Customers face delays in resolution, and managers lack real-time insights into support operations.

# Proposed Solution:
This project implements a Customer Support Ticketing System on Salesforce that enables customers to raise issues (cases), assigns them automatically to support agents, and escalates unresolved cases to managers. The system will provide automation for case assignment, notifications, approvals, and SLA monitoring. Additionally, dashboards will offer managers insights into performance, while Lightning Web Components (LWCs) will deliver an intuitive interface for agents and customers.
